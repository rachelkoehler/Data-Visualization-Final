The paper examines the recent decline in life expectancy in the United States, focusing on the period from 2015 to 2017, when life expectancy dropped for three consecutive years. The decline has affected nearly all race/ethnic and gender groups, and is attributed to several factors, including a rise in opioid overdose deaths, suicide, homicide, and Alzheimer’s disease. The slowdown in the decline of cardiovascular disease mortality has also contributed to the stagnation in life expectancy. The authors analyze mortality trends across different demographic groups, including race/ethnicity, gender, and age, and explore the geographic and socioeconomic dimensions of these trends. Additionally, the authors argue that interventions targeting opioid overdoses, suicide, and CVD are urgently needed to reverse the decline in life expectancy.
